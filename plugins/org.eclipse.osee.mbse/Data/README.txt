This package is not an eclipse plugin, instead it is a Cameo Plugin

To use it with Cameo, select Export from the menu, then export a jar file

The location of the exported jar file is the plugins directory of the Cameo Enterprise installation
Place the plugin.xml file in this directory into the same plugin folder as the jar file.

Then, the next time the Cameo is run, this code will execute, creating an OSEE Hyperlink capability.
