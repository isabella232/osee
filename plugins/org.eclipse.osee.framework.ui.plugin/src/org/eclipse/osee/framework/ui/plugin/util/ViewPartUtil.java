       * straight. So, we've opted to simply use an integer number for this purpose. Therefore, to startup another

       * numbers are preferable from a useability standpoint, and we'll start counting at 1. If a view is closed, we
       * should first re-use its number before going on to higher numbers. For example, if views with secondary IDs 1,
       * and 3 are currently running, the next instance of the view should be 2.
