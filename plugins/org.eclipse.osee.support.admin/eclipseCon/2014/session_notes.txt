	as much as possible Orion uses the native browser behavior
	can drag and drop files in
	can host at localhost or in the cloud
	templates and content assite for html, css, javascirpt
	
	npm - node package manager
	
	Orion allows for zero development environment setup cost (just need a web browser)
	
	Orion has two server implementations:
		Java - multi-user, has Git support, 
		Node - single user, no Git support but can run on a rasbery pi
	Orion client side components should work on any server implementation 
	
	use a piggy back CQ for the java source viewing

In 1867, the British philosopher and political theorist John Stuart Mill delivered an inaugural address at the University of St. Andrews. The second sentence in the excerpt below expresses part of the idea of the quotation under investigation [JMG]:

Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.

	user native broswer capabilities
	make it fast: focus on speed
		< 0.1 sec = instantaneous
		< 1.0 sec uninterrupted but disconnected from the data
		< 10 sec = retain attention but unhappy
		add caching header
		page loading will block during reading script tags (async load of java script)
		
		modern browser platform is consistent and good enough - remove cake fraework DOJO - go native
		factor of 3 load time improvement by removing DOJO (parse time of Java script is costly)
		minimize java script on your page
		
		replaced DOJO widgets with templates
		
		HTML 5 from WHATWG instead of WC3
			from senior executives who cared aboutstandardization to younger practitioners
			
		The brower is the platform not us
		no cake at all
	independent pages
		
		Use the URL class - do not use plain string manuiplulation
