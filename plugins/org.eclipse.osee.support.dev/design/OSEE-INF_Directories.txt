Essentially, there is/should be an OSEE-INF directory in each bundle that has supporting files like 
types sheets, test files, images and etc.

Exmaple of OSEE-INF directory in osee.ats bundle:
	atsConfig – Work Definitions 
	extensionPts – Eclipsie extension point definitions
	orcsTypes - *.osee types sheets
	toolsWeb – data supporting the generation of the CEE tools website

Other possible folder types:
	images – images used by ide client/web UIs
	requirements – word documents imported into test database
	blamUi – external xml files containing blam widgets
	web – pages and applications supporting web UIs
	
This not only makes things a little more organized, but could also support simpler code cause you can use OSGI 
annotations to “declare” certain directories/file as different types instead of using eclipse extensions.
