/**
 * Immediately removes each element from the underlying iterator when it is returned from calling next(). One use for a
 * DrainingIterator is when an iterator from a ConcurrentHashMap (i.e. ConcurrentHashMap.values().iterator()) is passed
 * to another method for iteration and the subsequent removal of each element is required. In that case, this class is
 * more than just a convenience because it is not safe to simply call ConcurrentHashMap.clear() after the iterator
 * finishes since the ConcurrentHashMap may well have been added to concurrently and this may or may not be reflected in
 * the iterator. Thus new additions to the ConcurrentHashMap might otherwise get cleared with out ever being accessed
 * through iteration.
