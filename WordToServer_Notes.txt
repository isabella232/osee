-Verify the Diff works in Resource History, F5 from change report, and publish with specific template blam.
-Verify the SRS publish works and all links work.
-Verify Data Rights (although I believe this works)
-OSGI service currently returning null in WordTemplateProcessor
-Verify every getRenderInputStream call goes through the main one in WordTemplateRenderer (besides TisRenderer) and hits the server
	-NOTE: the commented out Diff code can be removed in this method, that was not the correct place for that.

	
Things i need to move to server/Issues/Additional Notes:

	-redirect linux server to windows server for vbascript
	-RendererManager - do this in same move to endpoint creation
	-SkynetTransaction - make transactionOption a boolean (or use ParagraphNumbers?) and use txEndpoint on server to update paragraphNumbers
	-WordUiUtil - used to dislpay unhandled artifacts, how does server do client popups?
		-Displays - same as above
	-WordTemplateRenderer ? remove? or just pass options? is that all it is needed for?
	-change attributelement to use attributetypeid
	-delete attributeElement on client side
	- need getArtifactType on artifactReadable??
	-ChangeDataLoader line 180 artId.isValid()
	-RendererUtil has a display to ui commented out
	-WordTemplateProcessor line 345 
	-RelationOrderRenderer - no longer be supported.
	-WordTemplateRendererTest consolidate into 1 SRS test that uses all the renderer options


	-No longer supporting Relation Order attribute on server
	-RDT is being retired. Store wordml for all of history for RDT artifacts - edited in word moving forward.
	-move renderer clas registry to report
	-rename to RendererRegistry
	-/plugins/org.eclipse.osee.define.report.api/.project b/plugins/org.eclipse.osee.define.report.api/.project
		automatically adds buildcommand - why?
